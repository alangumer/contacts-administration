# Contacts Administration - Ruby on Rails

Allows a user to upload a comma-delimited file of contacts. The back-end parse the file, normalize the data, and store the information in postgress. The front-end displays the list of contacts, allows to delete a specific contact via ajax using React, and allows the list of contacts to be filtered via Javascript: contacts with '.com' email addresses and order the contacts alphabetically by email address.
